# GHSim
Small simulator of guitar hero using the tutorial sounds from Guitar Hero 3
  
  Currently this only works in an editor as I'm not going to bother integrating it into a page at the moment
  since this was a project for my class.
  
  To use it just download it, open it in an editor and run it on a local server.
  
  Pretty simple to use, press one of the buttons listed below to play the sound. 
  Colors are placed according to how they are in any Guitar Hero game.
  Placed chords onto seperate keybinds because, due to my limited knowledge at the time, coding two keypresses simultaneously in processing is obnoxious.
